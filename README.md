- <a href="https://moralis.io/" target="_blank">Moralis</a> - Provides API that makes easy to create dApps
- <a href="https://docs.ethers.org/v5/" target="_blank">Ethers.js</a> - Library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem

The purpose of this project was to learn about Chrome extensions and wallets. This project is a simple wallet extension that allows you to connect to your wallet and view your balance. It also allows you to send ETH to other addresses. This project uses the Moralis API to connect to the blockchain and get the balance and send transactions.
